This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Hey there! Welcome to my very first ReactJS project, I did it by following the very throught tic-tac-toe code along, by the beta [documentation] (https://beta.reactjs.org/). It was a great introduction to the React library alone, I learn it's core functionalities and good practices.
